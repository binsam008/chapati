📜 Project Description
An AI-powered web app that detects whether your chapati is raw, medium, perfectly cooked, or overcooked — based on an uploaded photo. It's basically Gordon Ramsay in your browser (but less angry).

❓ The Problem (that doesn’t exist)
People stare at chapatis, wondering, "Is this cooked or just sun-kissed?" And some never learn. Ever.

🤯 The Solution (nobody asked for)
Upload your chapati photo, and our AI will judge it mercilessly using image processing and a sprinkle of sass. No more raw rotis (unless you like chaos).

💻 Technical Details
🧪 Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
Languages: Python, HTML, CSS

Frameworks: Flask

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy

Tools: VS Code, GitHub, pip

For Hardware:
None. Just your camera, browser, and some good flour.

⚙️ Implementation
For Software:
🛠 Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install flask opencv-python numpy
▶️ Run

Copy
Edit
python app.py
Go to http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

📚 Project Documentation
💻 Software Side
🖼 Screenshots
![Upload Page](Add screenshot of index.html here)
User uploads chapati image from this dark-themed page.

![Result Page](Add screenshot of result.html here)
Displays cooking status like ✅ Perfectly Cooked, 🔥 Overcooked, etc.

![OpenCV Debug](Add screenshot of masked image or brownness ratio)
Shows how the brown pixels are detected using HSV color filtering.

🔁 Diagram
![Workflow](Add your OpenCV + Flask flow diagram here)
Image upload → Preprocess → HSV Filter → Brightness Check → Cooking Logic → Result Page.

⚡ Hardware Side
(N/A – unless you're uploading chapati from a drone or Arduino toaster!)
